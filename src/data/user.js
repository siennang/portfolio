		description:
			"My journey in technology began at Rutgers University, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and built a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve honed my software development skills and thrived in team environments. At Thunderbolt Health, I conducted market research and collaborated closely with team members. As a Front-End Developer at Penji, I transformed UI/UX designs into functional websites through active communication with design and backend teams. My expertise includes programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python, and C, as well as tools like Docker and Jira. I am dedicated to driving innovation in software development and fostering collaboration within teams.",
